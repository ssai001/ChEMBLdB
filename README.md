# ChEMBLdB
The repository ChEMBLdB contains numerous dataframes that detail the important drug annotation information which will be uploaded into the DrugBankR database. The overall goal is to implement the DrugBankR package with drug annotation information from ChEMBLdB in order to develop a new package altogether.
